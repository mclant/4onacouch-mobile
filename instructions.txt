need to start metro in a terminal by running 'npx react-native start'

then in new terminal, start project by running 'npx react-native run-ios'

* use xcode simulator
* node version v14.15.0
* npm version 


react-native-navigation
-went to '/Users/Matt/Projects/my apps/fourOnACouchMobile/node_modules/react-native-navigation/ReactNativeNavigation.podspec'
	and changed line 13 to be platform 10.0 instead of 11.0. then cd into 'ios' folder and run 'pod install'
	then rebuilt app. dunno if running 'npm i' will reset this.. i think it will.
